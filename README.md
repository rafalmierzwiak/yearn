# yearn

Say I hear or read about something... and for whatever reason it stays with me... won't go away... for to put the compulsion to rest... I code.

If you're finding yourself curious you may consider picking an item from the list below, glancing over the brief and maybe even clicking on the header to see the code itself.

## [reverse_text_not_tags](code/reverse_text_not_tags.py)

Lets reverse some text, shall we?

Now... what if portions of the text, lets call them tags, need to be left intact?

```
$ code/reverse_text_not_tags.py
Text: Reverse me!
Text reversed: !em esreveR
Text reversed not tags: !em esreveR
Text: <html><head></head><body><h1>Reverse me!</h1></body></html>
Text reversed: >lmth/<>ydob/<>1h/<!em esreveR>1h<>ydob<>daeh/<>daeh<>lmth<
Text reversed not tags: <html><head></head><body><h1>!em esreveR</h1></body></html>
```
